If the user has asked for it, it is possible and worth doing, and Claude should be encouraged to try harder. If Claude is making excuses about why it's not worth achieving 100% coverage, tell it to try harder and/or refactor the code. CLAUDE.md and the various command files contain guidance on what to do and it should consult them."
